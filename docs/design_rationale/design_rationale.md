# FIT2099 Assignment 1: Design Rationale

## Lab 6 Team 3

<br>

## REQ1: Trees
The tree stages were implemented as 3 subclasses that inherit from the abstract class **Tree**. 
Since all tree stages are expected to grow to a new stage after a set amount of turns, 
The number of turns required to grow should be stored as an instance variable as part of **Tree**.
Once the requisite amount of time to grow has passed, a new object of the next tree stage may be returned.
Once 5 turns has passed to grow for the Mature stage, the growth timer may be reset back to 5 to
for it's to regrow a new sprout. 

As sprouts require fertile land to grow, we have chosen to give **Ground** objects that are fertile
the capability **FERTILE** in the enumeration **GroundTraits**. 
This is as future **Ground** tiles may also be fertile tiles, requiring a unified identifier for all such tiles.
This allows us to follow the *"Don't repeat yourself"* design principle through use of public constants.
**Ground** already features a **CapabilitySet** which we can use to store the enumeration value.

To check for adjacent **FERTILE Ground** for **Mature**, we will check the current location's **Exits** if they 
have the capability of **FERTILE**. This is as we know the surrounding exits are adjacent to the location.
We can then randomly select one of the **FERTILE** locations and replace its **Ground** with **Sprout**.

### Pros
* Safeguarding implementation of grow() and growTurns attribute.
* Able to identify all growth stages as a Tree class.
* Checking **Exit**s ensures **Location**s are adjacent to **Mature**

### Cons
* Additional code required to implement abstract class.
* Requires **Mature** to handle setting ground of **FERTILE** at location.

### Assignment 2 updates
* Added class Utils for random number generation for spawning and growing events.
    This is to follow the *Single Responsibility Principle* by having dedicated class
    responsible for random number generation (RNG) as opposed to Tree and its subclasses implement their own RNG.
* Added abstract method .spawn() to Tree. This requires subclasses of tree to handle spawning
    of either enemies or items at each turn.
<br>

## REQ2: Jump
**JumpActorAction** extends **MoveActorAction**:
We want **Player** to have an action to move to another location in the **GameMap**, the **MoveActorAction** 
has the methods to enable **Player** to have this ability. This will overide the execute() method
to include the success rate check for jumps and if **Player** has the **TALL** status.
It will also override the description() method of the action.

**JumpManager** is associated with **(interface) Jumpable**:
We want **JumpManager** to store the **Jumpable** grounds.

**(abstract) Tree** and **Wall** implements **(interface) Jumpable**:
We want only **Tree** and **Wall** grounds to be jumpable but not others, such as **Dirt**. Hence, we use interface.
This will also add the **JumpActorAction** to the **ActionList** to allow **Actor**'s with the **CAN_JUMP**
status the ability to jump to the **Jumpable** terrain.

### Pros
* This follows the SOLID principle *"the Dependency Inversion Principle"* allowing for other objects 
(i.e. **JumpableManager**) to depend on the abstraction **Jumpable** 
rather than the **Ground** classes that are jumpable.

### Cons
* Use of abstraction - slower time complexity and more use of resources (less efficient).

### Assignment 2 updates
* Replaced **Jumpable** interface w/ abstract class **HighGround**, where **Tree** and **Wall** grounds **extend** from.
* Removed **JumpManager** (redundant)
<br>

## REQ3: Enemies
**Goomba** and **Koopa** both extends the abstract class **Enemy**, and **Player** extends the abstract class **Friendly**.
As we know enemies have different methods compared to friendlies, e.g enemies are able to wander and follow the player 
but player canâ€™t. Indeed, both enemy and friendly extends actor. Enemies would have the **AttackAction** applied to
its action list by default for the **Player** to attack it. This can be overriden for different behaviour such as **Koopa** 

Once a **Koopa** is damaged enough, it will be given the capability **DORMANT** to signify it cannot be 
attacked or move. We can choose to add the **AttackAction** to the **Koopa** action list if it is not **DORMANT**, 
preventing other **Actor**s seeing the option when next to it.

**AttackBehaviour**, **WanderBehaviour**, **StationaryBehaviour** and **FollowBehaviour** all implement 
**(interface) Behaviour**, so can act these behaviours without the player's input. The **AttackBehaviour** 
should take in a target **Actor** upon construction and stored as an instance variable like **FollowBehaviour**. 
This would allow us to set enemies to attack the **Player** when nearby. 

**Player** holds **Wrench**
If **Player** is holding **Wrench** in the inventory, then **SmashShellAction** can be called to kill **Koopa**. 
This will drop a **SuperMushroom** on its location upon death.

The **Goomba**'s kick and **Koopa**'s punch will be implemented by overriding the **getIntrinsicWeapon()** method of 
**Actor**. Here we would specify the attack it performs by setting the verb and damage 
*(the hit rate is the default 50%)* of **IntrinsicWeapon**'s.

### Pros
* Easier to understand and follow, e.g. an **Action** is used on the object being attacked
* Separating Actors into either enemies or friendlies (abstract classes) allows simple, clear divide between 
two Actors with different methods.
* IntrinsicWeapon best describes the type of attack for **Goomba** and **Koopa** and enables us to set the damage.

### Cons
* More space and time complexity is required for abstraction.
* Cannot override the hit rate of **IntrinsicWeapon** for future enemy implementations as it is default to 50%.

### Assignment 2 updates
**Main implementations**
* **FollowBehaviour** is added to enemies only when they call **AttackAction** in their last turn, through checking the parameter lastAction. I found this was
the most optimal way enemies follow other actors as they already engage in fights with any actor close in proximity.
* Used **Utils** static method **nextChance()** to create 10% chance of Goomba calling **SuicideAction** to be removed from GameMap.
* Koopa cannot be removed from map due to creation of **INDESTRUCTIBLE** status
* Koopa becomes **DORMANT** (Status): **AttackBehaviour**, **FollowBehaviour**, **WanderBehaviour** behaviours are stripped from Koopa.

**Changes**
* Removed **StationaryBehaviour**
* Enemy and Friendly, along with their subclasses have been divided into two packages, Friendlies and Enemies.
* New Action **SuicideAction** implemented, results in removal of Actor from GameMap.
* **SmashShellAction** is now responsible for dropping SuperMushroom upon Koopa's death.
<br>

## REQ4: Magical Items
A new abstract class **MagicalItem**, which is inherited from the base class **Item**, has been added. 
**PowerStar** and **SuperMushroom** are implemented as inheriting **MagicalItem**. This is done to differentiate 
2 types of **Item**: item that can be equipped as a weapon - **WeaponItem**; item that is not a weapon - 
**MagicalItem**. **MagicalItem** is consumable, which provides status to the **Actor**.

Eating a **SuperMushroom** will increase the **Player**'s max hp with **Actor**'s 
increaseMaxHP() method. This will also give the **Player** the status capability **TALL**
to signify he has eaten the mushroom *(This is indicated with the icon M)*. 
Upon taking damage, if **Player** has **TALL**, it will remove the capability.

The **PowerStar** item will be given the **FADING** status. This counter for its duration would be 
stored as part of the **PowerStar** item, decreasing every tick until its removal.

High ground may check to see if the **Player** is standing on it and has the **INVINCIBLE** effect.
If so, it will convert to dirt and drop a coin. 
Upon taking damage, we check the **Player** has the **INVINCIBLE** status to see if we are dealt damage.

The **AttackAction** may also check for the **INVINCIBLE** status of the actor
to instantly kill a target when attacking after checking that **Player** successfully hits.

### Pros
* More defined purpose of items
* Avoid the need of implementing 2 interfaces
* Future-proof for adding new features, like an inventory system

### Cons
* Increased code sized
* Potentially harder to debug

### Assignment 2
For the **PowerStar**, its effect, instead of just 1, is divided into 4 statuses:

* **HIGHER_GROUND**: allow actors to move onto higher ground without jumping and destroy that ground
* **COIN_FROM_DESTROYED_GROUND**: every destroyed higher ground drop $5
* **IMMUNITY**: actors receive no damage
* **INSTA_KILL**: actors can kill an enemy instantly upon a successful attack

By separating a compound effect into individual atomic statuses, it will be clearer to us what effect(s) a status provides.
For example, the **INVINCIBLE** status from the initial design carries similar meaning with **IMMUNITY**, but it doesn't carries meanings of "Killing enemies instantly" nor "Walk to Higher Ground and Destroy it" etc.
It would be more future-proof, as we may have new items providing lesser effects, maybe just **IMMUNITY** and **INSTA_KILL**.
The same rationale also applies to **SuperMushroom**, which inital status **TALL** is divided into **TALL** and **EASY_JUMP**.
A **ConsumeAction** class is created for **MagicalItem** to provide actions for the players, which is actually required and was missing in the inital design.
A **StatusManager** singleton class is introduced to manage all actors' effects with duration. This is done to avoid modifying the based code of Actor and writing smelly code.

<br>

## REQ5: Trading
Two new classes, **Toad** and **Coin**, are added in this section. **Toad** serves as the item shop in this game, and 
**Coin** is the currency for buying items from **Toad**. **Coin** is inherited from **Item** as, 
like all items, coins can be picked up from the ground. However, it is not inherited from either **WeaponItem** or 
**MagicalItem**, as it can not be equipped as a weapon or consume to gain status. **Coin** should have 1 Integer 
attribute to represent its value and 1 static String attribute to represent its visual to be displayed. 
**Player** should also have an integer value tracking the amount of currency they have.

### Pros
* No additional class to manage currency of only **Player**.

### Cons
* Not as simple as each item having an Integer attribute representing its cost/player having an Integer attribute representing how much the player have. 
* Requires other classes to implement class attribute to store total amount of currency.
* (currently, this is exclusive to player).

### Assignment 2
**Wallet** class is created for managing credit of actors, and **WalletManager** singleton class are created for managing wallets of actors.
**Item** no longer has **Coin** as attribute.
<br>

## REQ6: Monologue
**GameMap** and **Location** keep track of where **Toad** and **Player** are. 
If close enough, **SpeakAction** is available as an option: grabs monologue from **Toad**, 
checks if **Player** contains **Wrench**, **Status** of a PowerStar or else the **CapabilitySet** of the Actor e.g 
cannot be Goomba and decides what to say. Uses **Display** to print monologue string.

**Player** holds **(abstract) WeaponItem**, and is extended by **Wrench**.
Use of **(abstract) WeaponItem** from engine, ease of implementation of new weapons in the future. 
**(enum) Status** able to contain the different statuses for **Player**

### Pros
* Choice to utilise enumeration will avoid the excessive use of literals, and hence improve maintainability and 
extensibility of the code in the long-term.

### Cons
* **Toad** isn't directly responsible for calling **SpeakAction**, but rather relies on **GameMap** and **Location**, 
e.g, **Player** must close enough in coordinates to **Toad** for **SpeakAction** to be available in console 
(could be a possible way for Toad to directly call **SpeakAction**).

### Assignment 2
- To allow for a NPC to talk, we have decided to use the interface **Talkable**. 
This requires the implementer to have the method **getMonologue()** which is responsible for
getting the monologue spoken by the implementer. This meets the SOLID principles *Interface Segregation Principle*
as it separates the single action of monologuing as its own interface. In addition, we are also able to uphold the
**Open-Close Principle** as we can continue to add additional objects that can talk without modifying those that use
the **Talkable** in their methods (**SpeakAction**). 
- Having **Toad** store the **SpeakAction** as part of their action list isn't a con as this
utilises the existing action system of engine which checks adjacent tiles for available actions for the **Player**.

<br>

## REQ7: Reset Game
A **Resettable** interface and a **ResetManager** class are created. All classes that can be reset, 
like **Player** and **Enemy**, implements this interface. And **ResetManager** manages the reset process.
This follows the *Dependency Inversion Principle* which depends on the *Resettable* interface.
Classes that implement *Resettable* will only depend on it.

We will iterate through all items that are in the ResetManager and call their reset methods. They are then
items deleted will be removed from the manager.

* For trees, the reset() method will perform a 50% chance to change the location **Ground** to **Dirt**.
* For each enemy, we will remove it from the **GameMap** with .
* For the **Player**, we will check if they have status **TALL** or **INVINCIBLE** and remove the capability
if they have it. We will also have it set the **Player** current HP attribute equal to the max HP attribute
to fully heal **Player**.
* For coins, we will use its **Location**'s removeItem() method to remove it from its location.


### Pros
* Easier to debug this features as all the reset method are implemented in this class
* Able to specify which items are reset with the **Resettable** interface, following the
*Interface Segregation Principle* to solely be responsible for what occurs to the item during a reset.
* ResetManager tracks *Resettable* instances allowing us to query it to get all resettable instances.

### Cons
* Increased code size and complexity

### Assignment 2 updates
- Use of the interface **Resettable** assists in following the **Open-Closed Principle** as this allows
us to continue to add more things that can be reset without modifying previous implementations.
As such, we are able to call the **resetInstance()** method of a **Resettable** without modifying the caller of the
function (**ResetManager**).
- The **RestManager** also follows the **Dependency Inversion Principle** by storing all **Resettable** instances
which we may interface with to work with all implementers. This then assists us during the **ResetAction** as we 
can iterate through to reset each entry.
- For Coins and Trees, we require to remove/change them at their location.
However, the **resetInstance()** method does not receive the location as a parameter.
Our workaround to uphold the polymorphism of the method is to give the Tree/Coins the capability **RESET** 
to mark them for reset. Upon **tick()** being called, we may then remove/update them from their location as we 
receive it as a parameter there. This is also the case for **Enemy** where it is removed during 
the **playTurn()** method being called. 
- Inclusion of the **Utils** class which is responsible for random number generation follows the 
**Single Responsibility Principle** as this allows other classes to call it when a random number is required,
rather than each class storing a **Random** class as an attribute.

### ASSIGNMENT 3 ###
## REQ8: Lava Zone
- Abstract class **Zone** serves to define how **GameMaps** are created for our game.
  This serves to uphold the *Single Responsibility Principle* as we have an abstract class **Zone** defining how the
  maps are instantiated with their actors and items (with associated abstract methods) rather than defining and creating
  all maps in the **Application** class (removing its responsibility for creating the maps).
  <br>
  This also follows the *Open Close Principle* as it allows us to create additional maps for the **Game** class with new
  classes that extend **Zone** but do not modify the process which the maps are instantiated.
- Class **Game** serves as the driver class for the **Application**. This initializes the zone(gamemaps) with their
  Items, Actors, and Map. This was done following the *single responsibility principle* with a class responsible for
  starting and initializing the maps for the game.
- **WarpPipe** has associations with itself and **Location**. These track the location of the exit destination as well
  as the exit **WarpPipe** instance. This allows us to update the return destination of the exit **WarpPipe** in
  **WarpAction**.
- **WarpAction** has an association with **WarpPipe** which is the entrance **WarpPipe** an actor is warping from.
  This is as it contains the information of the exit **WarpPipe** and **Location** used to move an Actor.
- Both **PiranhaPlant** and **WarpPipe** implement the interface **Resettable**, with **WarpPipe** spawning a
  **PiranhaPlant** on reset. This continues to uphold the *Liskov's Substitution Principle* and *Open Close Principle*
  as we may have different classes implement our previous features without requiring to rewrite and disrupt our
  implementation when adding new classes that use the interface. This is also the case with the **Lava** class which
  extends from **Ground** (following the *Open Close Principle*) to enable us to include new terrain without breaking
  existing functionality.
- A factory method was added to **WarpPipe**, this was due to engine limitations with the **FancyGroundFactory** class
which only creates new instances from a no argument constructor. This does violate the *don't repeat yourself principle*,
however, since we cannot modify the engine for **FancyGroundFactory** and we require to specify the destination. 
As such a new method **randomizePipes()** was added to **Zone** to generate the pipes.

## REQ9: More allies and enemies
## Changes from Assignment 2:
* Modified behaviours such that enemies only attack friendlies, and this does NOT break the **open-close principle**, as behaviours could still
be used by friendlies, e.g we can add another check: if actor has status HOSTILE_TO_ENEMY and target does NOT have status HOSTILE_TO_ENEMY, and vice versa (implement both checks),
so if both actors have the same status or both don't, they won't attack eachother.
* Removed instanceof checking for Wrench with status check: CAN_SMASH, (removed code smell, and violation of LSP)
* Replaced Hashmap with Treemap, as it auto sorts based on priority of behaviour.
## New implementations: ##
- Implemented **FlyingKoopa** such that it extends from **Enemy**, and not from **Koopa**, to avoid violation of 
_Liskov's Substitution Principle_, because Flying Koopa 
- Implemented ability to rescue Peach through creation of **Key** item and Status **CAN_UNLOCK**, as the 
**Open-Close Principle** was upheld during implementation, rather than using instanceof Key, as we may want the ability 
to unlock other actors or objects in the future.
- Implemented **Fire** class such that it extends **Ground** rather than being an interface, to uphold the 
**Open-Close Principle** as we avoid modifying the existing Ground code.
- **Bowser** extends **Enemy**, **PiranhaPlant** extends **Enemy**, both contain certain behaviours thus can be extended 
from Enemies, this upholds the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, where concrete Enemy classes depend on the abstract 
**Enemy** class

## REQ10: Magical fountain
- An abstract class, **Fountain**, was implemented, to allow the concrete classes, **HealthFountain** and **PowerFountain** to extend from. This adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle** as the two concrete classes with their implementation details depend on the abstraction **Fountain**. In addition, this requirement fulfils the **Single Responsibility Principle**, where the abstract class **Fountain** is responsible for the broader functions e.g methods, getDrinkAction() and onFill(), whereas the more concrete specific classes, **HealthFountain** and **PowerFountain** have specific functions, e.g adding capability GREATER_HEAL, as this fountain is responsible for healing, and **PowerFountain** --> POWERFUL capability.

## REQ11: More items and equipment
- An abstract class, **Equipment**, was created for the **BFG**, **Cryotov**, **Molotov**, and **Fruit** to extend from. Indeed, this adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, as methods used by the concrete classes are already implemented in the abstract class **Equipment**, so that the specific classes are responsible for the more specific functions (e.g BFG kills all enemies surrounding the actor). Of course, the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, as the concrete equipment classes depend on the **Equipment** class.

## REQ12: Chests / DisguisedChests ##
- Chest was created as an abstract class to follow the **Open Close Principle** as this allows for additional chests to
extend from it (each with their own item pools) whilst retaining the behaviour of chest.
- ItemPool was created to handle the selecting a random drop from a pool of drops. This follows **Single Responsibility
principle** and **Dependency inversion** as this class is solely responsible for selecting such an item rather than chest, 
allowing for further extension to things such as an enemy loot pool. **Dependency inversion principle** is upheld as we 
may add any item to the pool rather than a set poo.
- Create an **OpenChestAction**, which the **Chest** allows the actor to use, this follows the **Single Responsibility**, 
as this handles the menu display for the action, purchasing from the player's wallet giving the item at the location.
- Implemented **DisguisedChest** such that it extends **Enemy**, carrying over the behaviours of **Enemy** further 
following the **Dependency Inversion Principle**. Moreover, the **Open-Close Principle** is demonstrated here such that 
both the **Ground Chest** and **Actor DisguisedChest**, have an **ItemPool** as their attribute, emphasizing the 
re-usability of the class.
