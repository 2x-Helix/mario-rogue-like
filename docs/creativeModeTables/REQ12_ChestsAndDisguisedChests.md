_Chests and Disguised Chests_

**Description**:
_This requirement implements a Chest, 'c' and Disguised Chest, 'c' into the game. Players can buy from a chest and a random item is dropped onto the Player. However, a Disguised Chest, which looks like a Chest, will attack Friendlies close to it, and reveal its true appearance, 'e'. Upon death, this Enemy will drop a random item onto its location._
